/*!
 * \brief The EXRHandler class
 * The handler uses the OpenEXR reference implementation of the EXR file format.
 *
 * The purpose of EXR format is to accurately and efficiently represent high-dynamic-range scene-linear
 * image data and associated metadata.
 *
 * Both reading and writing of EXR files is supported. When saving, the image is converted to 16-bit
 * and sRGB Linear color space (if not already so). If no color space is set in the image, sRGB is assumed.
 * When the handler is compiled with the default compile options, the loaded image is a 16-bit image
 * with linear color space.
 * Multiview images are also supported (read only) via imageCount(), jumpToImage(), etc....
 *
 * The following QImageIOHandler options are supported:
 * - ImageFormat: The image's data format returned by the handler.
 * - Size: The size of the image.
 * - CompressionRatio: The compression ratio of the image data (see OpenEXR compression schemes).
 * - Quality: The quality level of the image (see OpenEXR compression level of lossy codecs).
 *
 * The following metadata are set/get via QImage::setText()/QImage::text() in both read/write (if any):
 * - Latitude, Longitude, Altitude: Geographic coordinates (Float converted to string).
 * - CreationDate: Date the image was captured/created (QDateTime converted to string using Qt::ISODate).
 * - Comment: Additional image information in human-readable form, for example a verbal description of the image (QString).
 * - Owner: Name of the owner of the image (QString).
 *
 * In addition, information about image resolution is preserved and the preview is written for images larger
 * than 1024px.
 *
 * The following compile options are supported (defines):
 * - EXR_MAX_IMAGE_WIDTH: Maximum image width supported (read/write, default: 300000 px).
 * - EXR_MAX_IMAGE_HEIGHT: Maximum image height supported (read/write, default: 300000 px).
 * - EXR_LINES_PER_BLOCK: The number of scanlines buffered on both read and write operations.\n
 *                        The higher the value, the greater the parallelization but the RAM consumption increases (default: 128)
 * - EXR_USE_LEGACY_CONVERSIONS: The result image is an 8-bit RGB(A) converted without icc profiles (read, default: undefined).
 * - EXR_CONVERT_TO_SRGB: The resulting image is convertef in the sRGB color space (read, default: undefined).
 * - EXR_DISABLE_XMP_ATTRIBUTE: Disable the stores of XMP values in a non-standard attribute named "xmp".\n
 *                              The QImage metadata used is "XML:com.adobe.xmp" (write, default: undefined).
