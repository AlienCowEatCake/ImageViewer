2.8 Featured release
-----------------------

Changed ChangeLog direction
Fixed many typos in comments, thanks to Stefan Weil for doing that.
Fixed localization bug, added a new test case crayons.icc thnaks to Richard Hughes for providing the profile. 
Fixed a bug in optimizer that made some formats (i.e, bits planar) unavailable
Fixed misalignment problems on Alpha. The compiler does not align strings, and accessing begin of string as a uint16 makes code to fail.
Added some extra checks to the tools and examples.
Fix a bug that prevented to read luminance tag
BIG amount of functionality contributed/Sponsored  by Alien Skin Software: TransformStride, copyAlpha, performance plug-ins. Fixes some warnings as well.
