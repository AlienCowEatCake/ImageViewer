* mngplay *

a simple SDL-based mng player

This is a simple example program, using the Simple Direct media Layer
to display mng animation decoded by the new libmng implementation.

SDL and libmng are quite portable, but I've only tried it on x86 Linux.
Project files for MacOS, BeOS and Win32 are welcome. The code's fairly
rough at this point, but there was no example player for *nix in the
distribution. Patches welcome, of course.

On a unix-like system, the build instructions are simple:

(install and/or build the SDL libraries from libsdl.org)
(install and/or build the mng library from libmng.com)
./configure    (or ./autogen.sh if you're using the cvs source)
make
make install

To use the player:

mngplay <filename>.mng
