.lib & .def files to link an MSVC project against the standard DLL build with BCB.

Please note that this version is created for libmng 1.0.5, but should work with
1.0.6 as there were no API changes between the two versions.

These files are courtesy of Alex Volkov. Here's what he had to say about it:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That reminds me, I remade the MSVC libmng.lib for linking to the
bcb-generated dll. The .lib and its corresponding .def are attached. The
.def I generated by simply dumping all the exports from the bcb .dll and
later added the .def to the contrib/msvc/win32dll project. The .def is
necessary for MSVC to name the imports correctly, otherwise it produces
mangled symbol names. What is ironic is that it is not necessary to
completely build the dll with msvc -- you need just the resulting .lib --
but you still have to setup the entire project for building the dll because of
the stdcall calling convention. The resulting .lib is not perfect -- the hints
are all off, of course -- but it does the job. In any case, the win32 exes
linked with the attached .lib in fact work with bcb-generated dll just fine. I
know the building process can be somehow automated, but I have not had the time
to work on that, and for me it was a one-shot deal.

Alex.
