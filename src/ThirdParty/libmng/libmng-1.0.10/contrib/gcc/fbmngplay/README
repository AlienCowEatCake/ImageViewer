* fbmngplay *

a simple fbcon based mng player

This is a simple example program, using the kernel framebuffer device
to display mng animation decoded by the new libmng implementation.

This player is based on the SDL version included in the libmng package
from Ralph Giles  <giles@ashlu.bc.ca>. The code's fairly rough at this
point, but there was no example player for *nix in the distribution.
Patches welcome, of course.

On a unix-like system, the build instructions are simple:

(install and/or build the mng library from libmng.com)
make
make install

To use the player:

fbmngplay <filename>.mng <filename>.mng ...

To stop looping animations, press CTRL C or send a TERM or INT signal.

See the options with 
fbmngplay -h
