#. TRANSLATORS: When compression or decompression finishes,

#. device and inode numbers match what xz saw when it opened
#. the source file. If these checks fail, this message is
#. shown, %s being the filename, and the file is not deleted.
#. The check for device and inode numbers is there, because
#. it is possible that the user has put a new file in place
#. of the original file, and in that case it obviously
#. shouldn't be removed.
