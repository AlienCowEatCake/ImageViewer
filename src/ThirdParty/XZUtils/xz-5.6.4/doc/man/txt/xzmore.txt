XZMORE(1)                          XZ Utils                          XZMORE(1)

NAME
       xzmore, lzmore - view xz or lzma compressed (text) files

SYNOPSIS
       xzmore [file...]
       lzmore [file...]

DESCRIPTION
       xzmore displays text from compressed files to a terminal using more(1).
       Files  supported  by xz(1) are decompressed; other files are assumed to
       be in uncompressed form already.  If no files are given,  xzmore  reads
       from standard input.  See the more(1) manual for the keyboard commands.

       Note  that  scrolling  backwards might not be possible depending on the
       implementation of more(1).  This is because xzmore uses a pipe to  pass
       the  decompressed  data  to more(1).  xzless(1) uses less(1) which pro-
       vides more advanced features.

       The command lzmore is provided for  backward  compatibility  with  LZMA
       Utils.

ENVIRONMENT
       PAGER  If  PAGER  is  set,  its  value  is used as the pager instead of
              more(1).
