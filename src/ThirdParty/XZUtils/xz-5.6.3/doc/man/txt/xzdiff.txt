XZDIFF(1)                          XZ Utils                          XZDIFF(1)

NAME
       xzcmp, xzdiff, lzcmp, lzdiff - compare compressed files

SYNOPSIS
       xzcmp [option...]  file1 [file2]
       xzdiff ...
       lzcmp ...
       lzdiff ...

DESCRIPTION
       xzcmp  and  xzdiff  compare uncompressed contents of two files.  Uncom-
       pressed data and options are passed to cmp(1) or diff(1) unless  --help
       or --version is specified.

       If  both  file1 and file2 are specified, they can be uncompressed files
       or files in formats that xz(1), gzip(1), bzip2(1), lzop(1), zstd(1), or
       lz4(1) can decompress.  The required decompression commands are  deter-
       mined  from  the  filename suffixes of file1 and file2.  A file with an
       unknown suffix is assumed to be either uncompressed or in a format that
       xz(1) can decompress.

       If only one filename is provided, file1 must have a suffix  of  a  sup-
       ported compression format and the name for file2 is assumed to be file1
       with the compression format suffix removed.

       The  commands  lzcmp and lzdiff are provided for backward compatibility
       with LZMA Utils.

EXIT STATUS
       If a decompression error occurs, the exit status is 2.   Otherwise  the
       exit status of cmp(1) or diff(1) is used.
