XZGREP(1)                          XZ Utils                          XZGREP(1)

NAME
       xzgrep - search possibly-compressed files for patterns

SYNOPSIS
       xzgrep [option...]  [pattern_list] [file...]
       xzegrep ...
       xzfgrep ...
       lzgrep ...
       lzegrep ...
       lzfgrep ...

DESCRIPTION
       xzgrep  invokes grep(1) on uncompressed contents of files.  The formats
       of the files are determined from the filename suffixes.  Any file  with
       a  suffix  supported  by xz(1), gzip(1), bzip2(1), lzop(1), zstd(1), or
       lz4(1) will be decompressed; all other files are assumed to  be  uncom-
       pressed.

       If  no  files  are  specified or file is - then standard input is read.
       When reading from standard input, only files supported by xz(1) are de-
       compressed.  Other files are assumed to be  in  uncompressed  form  al-
       ready.

       Most  options of grep(1) are supported.  However, the following options
       are not supported:

           -r, --recursive

           -R, --dereference-recursive

           -d, --directories=action

           -Z, --null

           -z, --null-data

           --include=glob

           --exclude=glob

           --exclude-from=file

           --exclude-dir=glob

       xzegrep is an alias for xzgrep -E.  xzfgrep is an alias for xzgrep -F.

       The commands lzgrep, lzegrep, and lzfgrep  are  provided  for  backward
       compatibility with LZMA Utils.

EXIT STATUS
       0      At  least  one  match  was  found from at least one of the input
              files.  No errors occurred.

       1      No matches were found from any of the input  files.   No  errors
              occurred.

       >1     One  or  more  errors  occurred.   It is unknown if matches were
              found.

ENVIRONMENT
       GREP   If GREP is set to a non-empty value, it is used instead of grep,
              grep -E, or grep -F.
