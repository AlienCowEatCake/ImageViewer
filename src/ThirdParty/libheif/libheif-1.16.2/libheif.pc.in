# Contrary to older versions of libheif (<= 1.14.2), the available-codec-variables are now all set to 'yes'
# as since 1.14.0, codecs can be dynamically loaded at runtime and it is not possible anymore to determine
# the available codecs at compile-time. You'll get an unknown codec error at runtime if you try to use an
# unavailable codec.
