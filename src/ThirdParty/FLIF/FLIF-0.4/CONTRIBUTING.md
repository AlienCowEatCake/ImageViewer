Thanks for you interest in contributing to FLIF!

Do you want to contribute, but you do not know where to start?
Take a look here:
- The open issues in the main FLIF repository: https://github.com/FLIF-hub/FLIF/issues  (mostly C++ / C)
- poly-flif is a browser poly-fill for FLIF: https://github.com/UprootLabs/poly-flif  (JS / emscripten)
- UGUI: FLIF is a graphical user interface wrapper for the command-line utility: https://github.com/FLIF-hub/UGUI_FLIF (HTML / CSS / JS)
- http://flif.info is the official FLIF website. It is hosted on github, and you're invited to contribute to it! https://github.com/FLIF-hub/FLIF-hub.github.io (Jekyll / HTML / CSS)
- Benchmarks are useful not just to compare FLIF to other formats, but also to evaluate modifications in FLIF itself. Test images and benchmark scripts are collected here: https://github.com/FLIF-hub/benchmarks (Shell scripts / Gnuplot)
- Documentation related to FLIF (including, eventually, the detailed format specification) is here: https://github.com/FLIF-hub/FLIF-doc (LaTeX)

FLIF is currently licensed under the GNU LGPL v3+. The decoder library `libflif_dec` is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.
When the project is more mature, we (Jon Sneyers and Pieter Wuille, the primary/initial authors of FLIF)
may want to release it under an even more permissive or a different Free Software license should that become desirable.

For this reason, we ask contributors (i.e. authors of a pull request) to agree to the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) you can
find in the file FLIF-CLA-template.txt in this repository. That allows us to relicense FLIF, including your contributions, if needed.

More precisely, the set of _potential_ outbound licenses that can be considered,
are the GPL-Compatible Free Software Licenses as listed on this page:
https://gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses

Please add your signed CLA to http://github.com/jonsneyers/FLIF-CLAs/
(you can find a template in FLIF-CLA-template.txt)
