<h1>NEAREST API CALL</h1>
<pre>#include &lt;windows.h&gt;

BOOL32 BitBlt
(
    HDC32 hdcDst,
    INT32 xDst,
    INT32 yDst,
    INT32 width,

<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
DIBBITBLT is the operand that BitBlt converts to automatically when
used with a metafile. It has <b>two</b> forms so watch out.<p>
DibBitBlt basically copies a dib into a dest location 
transformed by the ROP, but it can also be used with ROP's
that dont use the src at all.
<p>
Form 1<br>
In the scenario where hdcSrc is NULL, then the arguments are
as follows
<table border=1>
<tr><td>U16</td><td>Value</td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td rowspan=2>rop</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>ySrc</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>xSrc</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>???, probably nothing</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>height</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>width</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>yDst</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>xDst</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Form 2<br>
In the scenario where hdcSrc is not NULL, then the arguments are
as follows
<table border=1>
<tr><td>U16</td><td>Value</td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td rowspan=2>rop</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>ySrc</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>xSrc</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>height</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>width</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>yDst</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>xDst</td></tr>
<tr><td>8 until the end</td><td>the src dib<td></tr>
</table>
<p>
rop is the ROP.<br>
ySrc is the starting y coord to copy from (in log units i suppose) in the dib (if it exists).<br>
xSrc it the x coord to copy from (in log units i suppose) in the dib (if it exists).<br>
height is height in logical units of the destination rectangle<br>
width is width in logical units of the destination rectangle<br>
yDst is the y pos in logical units of the rectangle to copy to in the destination window<br>
xDst is the x pos in logical units of the rectangle to copy to in the destination window<p>

The primary purpose of this is to copy a dib to a given location, but it can be used to
do all sorts of ROP tricks as well or instead.

<p>Some realworld examples and thoughts at the time on DIBBITBLT
<pre>

DIBBITBLT is created from a BitBlt call, i havent seen BITBLT in the wild at
all and suspect that it doesnt exist.

theres two sets of possibilites for the parameters.
one that fits the layout of the call which is used 
when the src is NULL, i.e....

head
40 09

0 }__dwRop
1 }

2 srcy  
00 00

3 srcx  
00 00

4       ?
00 00

5 height
50 00

6 width
50 00

7 dest y
00 00

8 dest x
5a 00

and the other when src is not NULL, with the calls that use
src, where in effect argument 4 (the src dc) is missing
and the dib placed after the end of the parameters. I suppose
you can tell one from the other either by looking at the
no of parameters, or by seeing if no 4 is 0, or by seeing
if the dwROP requires a src, i use approach one, as its simple.
