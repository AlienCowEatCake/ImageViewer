(4) Caolan McNamara was original author of libwmf, and although I (Francis
    James Franklin) have reworked much of it the core of the interpreter
    (i.e., the most important part) owes everything to Caolan.

(6) Bob Friesenhahn linked libwmf into ImageMagick, so now you are able to
    convert WMF files to anything ImageMagick supports using the handy
    ImageMagick command syntax.

(7) Other contributors include Raj Manandhar, Steven Michael Robbins, Bob Bell
    Albert Chin and Matej Vila. Also, Benjamin Geer, Peter Ohlerich, Steve Oney
    and Michael Cree have helped with debugging.

(8) Finally, special thanks to Dom Lachowicz for all sorts of reasons.
