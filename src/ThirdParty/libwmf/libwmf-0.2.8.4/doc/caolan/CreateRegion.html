<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
Now on this one, i havent a clue, so heres what the wine source has to say on the 
matter, i blithered for a while and gave up and just dumped the wine source into
libwmf and waved a dead chicken over it, and it appears to work for rectangular
regions so....

/*
 *  The layout of the record looks something like this:
 *  
 *   rdParam    meaning
 *   0      Always 0?
 *   1      Always 6?
 *   2      Looks like a handle? - not constant
 *   3      0 or 1 ??
 *   4      Total number of bytes
 *   5      No. of seperate bands = n [see below]
 *   6      Largest number of x co-ords in a band
 *   7-10       Bounding box x1 y1 x2 y2
 *   11-...     n bands
 *
 *   Regions are divided into bands that are uniform in the
 *   y-direction. Each band consists of pairs of on/off x-coords and is
 *   written as
 *      m y0 y1 x1 x2 x3 ... xm m
 *   into successive rdParam[]s.
 *
 *   This is probably just a dump of the internal RGNOBJ?
