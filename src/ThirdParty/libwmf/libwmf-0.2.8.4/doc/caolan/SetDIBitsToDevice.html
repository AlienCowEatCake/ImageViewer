coloruse is one of either DIB_RGB_COLORS or DIB_PAL_COLORS<br>
lines is the number of lines in the dib to copy, in fact only
this number of lines *exist* in the dib attached to the record, the
header of the dib may tell you that there's more lines in
the dib that there actually is, so you must use this value to determine
the truth (nasty eh!)<br>
starting line is the line of the original dib that was to be the starting
line to copy from, in the metafile record you can ignore this, as the
attached dib is cropped as far as this line, so this work is done for you<br>
xSrc, and ySrc are the location in the dib to copy from, im uncertain of
these for the moment, as all examples have them to set to 0<br>
cy and cx are the size of the destination rectangle, with xDest and yDest
being the coordinate of the topleft of the dest rect.<br>
the rest of the bytes are the dib itself, but remember the height of the
dib, as shown in its header may be wrong, use the lines parameter to
determine the truth
