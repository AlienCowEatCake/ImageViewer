o Do we need to check for memcpy (), memset (), ... ??
o Does Win* have unlink () ?? Better to remove() ??
o Should I be opening files with "rb" & "wb" - check!

o crop, width, height, etc. tests for bitmaps
o further tests for division by zero

o Add a dpi option in wmf_eps_t struct ??
o eps,gd,x: bmp_draw ignores bitmap type

o -geometry option to wmf2x doesn't work properly; ditch position ??

o Does that (X) flood fill function really work?
o What is the proper order of x & y coordinates in lists of points in *poly* ??
o Check mismatch in DIBSTRETCHBLT/crop

o Need to check use of font map options

o in player/dc.h, pointers set up to default brush/pen/font; are these over-written ??

o reset bounding box before play ?? (in which case, need to remove SCAN() qualifies around
  registration...)

o what is opacity for non-32bit bitmaps? assuming 0xff, but maybe 0x00 ??

o xwmf in official libwmf tree: (a) renders test11.wmf incorrectly
o                               (b) angles text the wrong way

o scaling of pattern brush? - multiply imaging is possible but potentially expensive... PS forms ??

o I'm uncertain about the eps arc-draw functions... Does anyone have an elliptic pie-chart ??

o char width calcs using wmf_D_Coord_translate need to translate origin as well! - check
- why not just multiply by pixel_width? or have official scale function...

o finish eps,gd text: need underline (& strikethrough ?? (& ... ??))
o eps,gd,x: ROP ??
o eps fill transparency/color gets trashed on x86 - this seems to be a problem with ghostscript...
  ... but what to do about it?

o gd,eps,x: Has the rounded rectangle been implemented ??
o gd,eps,x: PS_INSIDE_FRAME - How to implement this (see gdwmfapi.c...)
o gd,eps,x: drawpixel implementations aren't scaling...

o add wmf_attach () & wmf_detach () functions for inserting/removing memory from libwmf MM array ??

o add WMF_SCAN_HEADER option ?? not sure this is a valid test. Why not do a full scan?

o original libwmf: gd_draw_rectangle uses height instead of width?

o with arcs, if start and end points the same then the player should request an ellipse, *not* an arc

o x: use of unqualified arrays is perhaps dangerous ??
o x: flood fill

o x,gd: angled text: I'm not entirely convinced about this;
- also, bounding box may be at wrong angle...
- in fact, bad assumption here: what references WMF_TEXT_ANGLE that shouldn't ??

o gd: background colour is black instead of white?
