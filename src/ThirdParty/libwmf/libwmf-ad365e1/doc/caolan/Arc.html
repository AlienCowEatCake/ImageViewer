</table>
left, right, top and bottom are the extents of the ellipse of
which the arc is a part<br>
xstart,ystart define a point from which you draw an imaginary line
between it and the center of the ellipse, where that line intersects the
ellipse is the starting part of the arc<br>
xend,yend similiarly define the end of the arc.<p>
This is quite different from how X, and other drawing lib's define an Arc,
and its somewhat awkward to convert from it to X's mechanism, see the
X bindings for libwmf for info on that.
