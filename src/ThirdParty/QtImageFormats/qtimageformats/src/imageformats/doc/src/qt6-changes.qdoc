    \title Changes to Qt Image Formats

    \brief Migrate Qt Image Formats to Qt 6.

    Qt 6 is a result of the conscious effort to make the framework more
    efficient and easy to use.

    We try to maintain binary and source compatibility for all the public
    APIs in each release. But some changes were inevitable in an effort to
    make Qt a better framework.

    In this topic we summarize those changes in Qt Image Formats, and provide guidance
    to handle them.
