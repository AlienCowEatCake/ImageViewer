<PRE>This is to notify you that basICColor GmbH has changed its public  
profiles licenses to the OSI compatible libz/libpng licenses. This  
means that the L-Star profile as well as the default CMYK profiles,  
which can be found on www.colormanagement.org, can be distributed with  
a Debian accepted license.

The license now reads for L-Star RGB:
